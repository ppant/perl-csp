In this project I am trying to implement Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) algorithms. Initally I am working on Backtracking, Backjumping and Backmarking alogorithms.
I will try to solve some of the logic puzzle like N-Queen and Zebra problem and later will try to introduce some asynchronous backtracking techniques for solving some real time scheduling problems.
Will soon push some Perl code. I will be using new version of PDL for manipulating N-dimensional arrays.
